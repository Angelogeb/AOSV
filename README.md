# AOSV

The repository holds the lecture notes of Spring 2018 of the Advanced Operating
Systems and Virtualization course held by Alessandro Pellegrini. There are two
branches, namely `online` and `master`. In the former there are the notes as
taken in class while the latter are the notes rewritten with the support of
integrating material, classmates and professor.

The repo is a bit dirty in its current state and the `online` version of
lectures <= 5 does not really exist.

Some lectures may have in the reference part stuff that is unrelated to the
lecture just because new folders are created by copying and pasting older ones
(this is because the format of the latex file is defined within each tex file,
hopefully one day it will be clean).
